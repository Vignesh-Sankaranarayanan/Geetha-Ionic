  Since its inception in 1978, the Geetha Mandalam has played a key role in preserving our religion, culture, and tradition in the Chicagoland Hindu Malayalee Community. However, it has played a larger role in uniting us as a family. It is about the person who offered help when you needed a ride to doctor's office. This kinship is about the buddy you grew up with, a brother or sister you never had. This organization is about the only Aunty or Uncle your little one has been. This community is about those special occasions when we shared a prayer, a meal , 0r a liitle laughter together. this is about that bond that make you teary-eyed when you find out someone you know for many years is not keeping good health. The 
  Geetha Mandalam is all of the above, and much more to us....
         On his visit to England and Europe, Mahatma Gandhiji once said, and I am paraphrasing here.... "Human nature is much the same, no matter under what climate it flourishes, and that if you approched people with trust and affection you would have ten-fold trust and thousand-fold affection returned to you." 
  Geetha Mandalam was built upon a foundation of trust and affection for it to have thrived these many years.......
